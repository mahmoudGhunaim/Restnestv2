                            Our comprehensive service comes at a fee of 30% of the total rental value. For example, on a $10,000 rental value with a $500 cleaning fee and $1,000 in taxes, the owner receives a $7,500 payout, with the remainder covering our services. Please note, taxes, cleaning, and any other additional fees are charged to the guest.
